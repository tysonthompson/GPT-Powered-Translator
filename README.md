# GPT-Powered-Translator

This project is a simple text translation tool powered by GPT-3. You can enter text in the input field, select the target language, and click the "Translate" button to receive the translation. The backend of this project is implemented in Python using the Flask framework. It provides an API endpoint that receives text and target language as input, sends the request to the GPT-3 model, and returns the translation to the frontend. The frontend is built using React, a popular JavaScript library. It offers a user-friendly interface where you can input text and choose the target language. When you click "Translate," the frontend sends a request to the Python backend, which handles the translation process. The translated text is then displayed on the frontend. Together, this project demonstrates the integration of a Python backend with a React frontend to create a practical and user-friendly text translation tool.
